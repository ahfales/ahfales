This is a very imperfect personal website that I hope to keep updating and redesigning as I develop my web design knowledge. A few years ago, I did some basic lessons via Codeacademy, and I'm currently trying to gain some more thorough knowledge via the Odin Project, starting from scratch. I hope to use this website as something of a sandbox. If you are interested in my current non-coding work, you can find more up-to-date information at adamfales.com.
